 Labor Market Information Insertion System is a web and mobile-based software portal that is designed with the prime objective of facilitating industries and organizations with skilled manpower and jobseekers with their desired job. This application works in close association with both the labor market and employment generator. Any organization seeking manpower can simply announce vacancies through the application, and job seekers can view the job, submit their qualifications and educational experience, and apply for it. The organization can also shortlist from the application and select desired candidates.
